# Enigma-Machine
This program simulates the encryption and decryption operation of the "Enigma Machine", the form of encryption and decryption is the same as that used by the original machine.
How to use the machine: 
When you run the software in the upper part there are three "rotors" in order to send an encrypted message you have to choose which rotors will be in the machine and under which position each of them will be, in the lower part there are all the letters of the alphabet where you can choose to connect two letters and it encrypts the message Furthermore, when you type a message in "input" the left rotor will go up by one, every time the left rotor completes a revolution (after it reaches 26) the middle rotor will go up by 1 and every time the device completes a revolution the right rotor will go up by one, etc., "output" Displays the encrypted message that can be sent, whoever receives the message has to change the rotors to the position where the sender started writing the message, and connect the letters that the sender connected, then type the encrypted message he received and the output will show the original message.
