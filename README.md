# Enigma-Machine
This program simulates the main encryption and decryption operation of the "Enigma Machine", the form of encryption and decryption is almost identical to the form used by the original machine.
You can choose which rotors will be in the machine and in which position each of them will be
When you run the software at the top there are three "rotors" in order to send an encrypted message you need to choose which rotors will be in the machine and in which position each of them will be, When you type a message in "input" the left rotor will go up by one, every time the left rotor completes a turn (after it reaches 26) the middle rotor will go up by One and every time the device completes a rotation the right rotor will go up by one, the "output" displays the encrypted message that can be sent, whoever receives the message has to change the rotors to the position that the sending party started writing the message, then type the encrypted message he received and the output will display the original message .
